80 noras. cnarrnn io. [riser

17. adfirmavit: corsyirmed; ior that Britain is an island bad been
asserted by Pytheas and others, but Agricola's fleet first demonstrated
it. It is to this achievement that the only ancient author, besides
Tacitus, who mentions Angcola, refers. Cp. Dio Cass. LXVI. 20.

18. Orcadas: ie. the Orkneys. That they were wholly unknown
up to this time, as Tacitus states, is disproved by Mela and Pliny. -
The Greek accusative plural occurs in Tacitus but rarely and only in

' proper names. cp. Germ. 453 Hist. IV. 553 Aac. 111.61; IV. 51;

Xll. 32, 33, 38; XIV. 29.

19. Dispecta: was descried ic the distonoc; but, unlike the Ork-
neys, Thule was not subdued, because they had no orders to do so,
and even ii they had, the approaching winter would have made it
inexpedient to attempt its subjugation, the tacit assumption being that
the Romans would have had no difficulty in accomplishing the task. -
The verb at the beginning, and at the same time ln juxtaposition with
domuit, skillfully emphasizes the antithesis. Thule: first mentioned
by the distinguished navigator, Pytheas oi Massilia (4th cent. aa),
and regarded by the ancients generally as the most northerly point oi
the earth, hence ultima Thule (Verg. Georp. l. 30). It was said by
Pytheas to be six days' sall irom Britain, the night and day being six
months long. Hence it has been rashly identified by some with Ice-
land. The island here referred to was probably Mainland, the largest
of the Shetland group. It can be seen from the Orkneys. hao-
tenus: sc. progredi, to cdocaoe ap to this point only, with special
reference to dispecto est. Their orders were to return, so soon as
Thule was sighted. 'l'he omission of tantum is a noteworthy Latin
idiom. at=et praetcrea. Inthistreatise again ch. 11, 5; 15, 30;
26, 17 ; 29, 24; 30, 27; 31, 205 38, 26. So also ac (l. ibt—The date
(83 nn.) as well as the season oi the year is fixed by ch. 38, 29.

20. mare pigrum: corresponds to the πεπηγυῖα θάλασσα oi
Pytheas, the more concretam oi Pliny, and may represent the scas
oi the northern ocean filled with ficating massas oi ics in which an-
cient marinens may well have found it difficult to make any headway.
In the Germ. 45, 25 the ocean east oi scandinavia is similarly styled
ocare piarum cc prope inmotum. As we see from this description, the
knowledge oi these regions had been but little advanced in the four
centurias that separate Tacitus from Pytheas. —On the brachylogy in
this clause, cp. Introd. p. xxxiii. perinde: sc. ac cetera maria, an
elliptical comparlson common with perinde, aeque, and the like. This
sluggish sea is not stirred like other sheets oi water even in a storm.
