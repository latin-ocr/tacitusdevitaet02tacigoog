LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA. ix

It is asserted that the work contains too much historical
matter for a biography and too many biographioal features
for ahistory. In the second place, the detailed account oi
the ethnology and geography of Britain, and the elaborate
speeohes put into the mouth of the Caledonian chieftain
and of the Roman general on the eve of the decisivo battle,
are pronounoed to be wholly out of place in a genuine

biography. One scholar even went sofar as to maintain
that all these alleged irrelevant portions, to which he added
the twentyeighth chapter, commemorating the adventure
of the Usipi, were not originally designed to form an in-
tegral part oi this treatise, but represented certain prelimi-

nary studies oi the author, the results oi which were to
be incorporated into his Historias, in the narrative oi the
British campaigns under Domitian. Apart from other con-
siderations to be mentioned presently, this hypothesis
makes it extremely difficult to understand why the last
book of that work was not published till 109, if Tacitus
had as early as 97 already begun the collection of his ma-
terial for the reign of Domitian. As a matter of fact, we
happen to know that as late as·106 he was still searching
for information in connection with an event to be related
under the year 79 nn}

But these objections are unwarranted, for not only do the
alleged sections so confidently pronounced irrelevant suh
serve a definite and legitimate purpose, but—what has
hitherto been overlooked-it ean be shown that Tacitus
has carefully conformed to the rules oi rhetorio laid down
for biographioal oornposition.²
