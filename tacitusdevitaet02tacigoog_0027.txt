told us that it was a biography 11 his father-in-law, written
as a warm tribute 11 affection, and inspired by the sineere
conviction that his achievements well merited the plaudite
11 posterity.1 But modern scholars will not have it s0.²

Some have maintained that it was 3 political pamphlet
in the guise 11 an historical monograph, cmbodying the
politieal platform 11 a moderate party as opposed to the
imperialists 11 the one hand 311 the 1311131 republicans on
the other. Unfortunately for this hypothesis we happen
to know that no such party organizations ever existed in
Rome either in the days 11 Agricola or during any other

Still another theory,8 advocated with singular ingenuity
and dialectioal skill, saw in the Apm'eolo only a eolorless

brazenly vilifying the old. But this captatio benevolentiae,

consolor office, Tacitus 'disappeared from the politica] arena.
ln order to justify this scathing impeaehment, Hoffmann
does not shriuk from manufacturing damaging evidence
against Tacitus out 11 the most innocent utteranoes, aecus·
