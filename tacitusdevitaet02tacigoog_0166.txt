present happy age, and he prophetIcally ioretold the accession oi
Trajan to the throne. Trajan's achievements in Germany before
91 ara, the year oi his consulship, had drawn attention to him, as ln
the similar case oi Vespasian (ch. 13, 28 ff.) and his future greatness
seems to have been generally predictcd. Op. Plin. Paney. ὁ, 94; Dio
Cass. LXVII. 12,1. The involved structure oi the sentence was due
to the author's strivIng after conciseness.

t. apud noemae auxta: in my presence. An instance oi synec-
doche. This particular quasi-personification occurs ln four other
Tacitean passages, viz. Hist. I. 26 ; Ana. Ι. 31; Il. 39; IV. 29, but
apparently not elsewhere. ominabatur = augurabatur ct ualde
optabat. An instance oi the so-oalled constructio praegnans. cp.
Iatrcd. p. xxxid. testimtae mortts:·objective genitive. The
passive meaning is first found in Sallust, eg. Icy. 64, 6, with the
implication of prematurely iuliicted death, eg. Juv. IV. 95 1., mors
. . . festinata.

8. endem: sc. eum, lethe subject oi solacium tulit, sc. nobis, as
contrasted with sicat ei (l. 5).

9. spiramenta: in thIs figurative sense the word occurs only here
and in Tacitus's imitator, Amm. Marcell. XXIX. 1, 40, who substitutos
'mora ior interuallu,· XIV. 7, 15.

10. continuo et velut: uno ictu: ic. blows dealt ont so un-
ceasingly ae to amount to but a single stroke. continno is not used
as an adverb by Tacitus, but may bo conveniently translated as such
here.

11. exhausit = perfodit,· merely a strengthened form oi beurere
which is very often used iu this sense. Cp. eg. Claud. Quadrig. apud
Gell. N. A. IX. 13, lI; Lucret. V. 1322; Liv. VII. 10, 10, uno altero-
que subinde ictu uentrem atque inguina bausit,· Tac. Hist. Ι. 41,
inputant eiua baueiese. The other, generally accepted meaning, to
drinio ap tlte blood, sap the strength os, though still more common both
in the slmple and compound verb, would unnecessarily introduces
mixed metaphor.

Ohupter 45. 12. Non vidlt, etc: such passages are typical oi
rhetorical consolationes, a species oi compositIon much cultivated In
ancient literature. Cp. Clade orat. ΙΙΙ. 2, 8, concidit (sc. Crassus)
flagrantem bello Italiam . . . non sceleris nefarii principes ciuitatis
rece. . . non atilium generi, non . . . 0. Mari ,ingan . . iton
illam . . . caedem omnium crudelissimam, etc. Sulpicius ln Cio. cd
