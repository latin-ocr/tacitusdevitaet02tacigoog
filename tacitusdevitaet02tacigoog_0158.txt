With the combination, ep. Hist. I. 76 and ch. 32, 4. The ablativae are
caueal. malignitate et livore: se. in Agricolam. Instrumental
ablativos, joined to balance the synonymia group preceding. On the

, Pege 28. 1. pronum: afavorita word 01 Tacitus, construed also .
with cd or in. With dative as here, eh. 33, 13. deterioribus:
neuter. Tacitus is habitually unmindful 01 the possible ambiguity 01
such iorms. cp. eg. eh. 1,3; 16, 22; Didi. 19, 8; 21, 16, Hist. I.
51, recentibas‚· Ann. IV. damnanationem especially 011011 in the

had been appointed consul in the fall 01 77 n.n., and Tacitus leit
Rome, undoubtedly in some official capacity, about 89s90 (ep. ch.
