upon those who lived through these dreadful times. multi . . .
promptissimus quisque. ..pauclz notice the asyndeton. ior-
tuitie casibus: crolup to natural oeceses. cp. Ana. XII. 52, morte
fortuito ou per· cenenum extinctus. Tacitus means to say that during
tha reign oi terror most oi the illustrious men capable of telling ite
story had died a natural or violent death, while the few that survived
were too crushed in spirit and unlike their real selves to undertake
the taslr.

24. promptissimus quisque: the plural verb after quisque, with
or without the superlative, is found in all periods of the language, but
is comparatively rare in claseical prose, except in Livy.

25. ut lta dixerim: like its equivalent at sic dixerim (eg. Dicl.
34, 23), is a postAugustan phrase ior ut iic dicam. -The s0·called

logical perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses is very rare. -The ·

expressionis here used to apologiae ior the seeming paradox innostra·
superstites.

26. exemptis e media vita tot annis: elsewhere in Tacitus
eximere invariably takes the dative-medic cito is an clastic term.

Thus in ch. 44, 26, it is appliedtoAgricola, at the age of 54. Accord- ,

lng to a belief common among the Romans, 120 years constituted the
extreme natural limit oi human life. Tacitus himself was about 26
years old on the accession of Domitian (81 an), and therefore but
41 at Domitian’s death. Senectus usually began attha age of 60.

27. ipsos exactae aetatis terminos: tc thecery limite os extreme
old epe. Such fullness of expression, still frequent in the minor
wrltings of Tacitus, gradually disappears in the later works.

28. per silentium: i.e. in compulsore silence, because of the
danger to which an honest historian or biographer would have exposed
himself. nontamen: in spite of the terrible ordeal through which
we passed.

29. pigebit. . . composuisse: the perfect infinitive refers to the
time when the implied action is completed. Op. Verg. Aea. VIl. 233,
nec. . . excepisse pigebit. vel incondita ao rudl voce: these
terms are habitually used of an archaia and inartietic diction, but es
= the Historias here alluded to-they were not completed till 109—are
written in a style of consummate art, these epithefs must not be taken
too seriously. similar apologetic or mech-modest expressions occur
elsewhere, eg. Cic. Orat. 69, 230 (concerning Antipater-'s introduction
to his Punic War); Stat. Silo. I. praef, Apul. Met. Introd.; Fronto,
. p. 2423 Aeliau, Not. Hist. IV. 1 ff. ; Liban. 1276 f.
