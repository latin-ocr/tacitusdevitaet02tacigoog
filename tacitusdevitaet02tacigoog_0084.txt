30. testimonium: memoria could not have been used with prce-
sentium bonorum, because the still uncompleted reign of Traian was
included among these. But, when the Historiae had been published,
their author had decided to reservo the record oi N erva's and Trajan’s
beneficent rule ior an independent work, a plan either abandoned or

¹frustrated by his death. Cp. Hist. 1. 1, quod si vitu suppeditet, priu— ¹

cipetum Nervae et imperium Traiani . . . senectuti reposui.

31. interim: ie. pending the conclusion oi my larger and strictly
historical narrative.

32⁴. laudatus erit aut excusatus: cp. Dici. ch. 10, 7, probata sit
fides et tibertus excusatu. —The fut. peri. with reference to the reader’s
completed perusal oi the biography. Cp. note ch. 1, 14, opus suit

Pago 3. Chapter 4. 1. Gnaeus Iulius Agricola: this is the -
only certain instance in Tacitus in which the tric ueratro Romanorum
occur. They are designed to give to the beginning of the biography
properaspecial solemnity Foroiuliensium colonie: atown in
Gallia Narbonensis, on the Mediterraneum founded by Julius Caesar
in 46 nc. ; during the early empire it was a naval station of some im-
portance. It is the modern Frejus, situated 45 miles northeast oi
Toulon.

2. procuratorem caesarum: the procuratore were officere in the
imperial household, appointed by, and solely responsible to, the em-
peror. These positions were originally held by ireedmen and equites
alikc, but as the administrativa iunctione of the emperor extended,
the higher and more responsible procuratorships were given only 'to
knights, who were then generally distinguished irom the minor ‘pro-
curatores’ as procuratores Augusti. Caesarum happens to be found
only here, but Caesaris may have been equally official, the plural
being used doubtless because the grandfathers referred to served sep·
arately under Augustus and Tiberius, or under both. But cp. Diui.
ch. 7, 7, procuratores principum.

3. quae: by attraction for quod. Cp. ch. 7, 8; (ierus. 5, 18.
equestris nobilitas: these offices had become one of the marks ol
an equestrian career, for men of senatorial rank were debarred from
holding a procuratorship. The expression itseli, in place of orric
equestris, seems not to occur elsewhere, aud is here used in the same
technical sense which Tacitus repeatedly gives to equites inlustres or
insigues, namely, knights occupying high positione. The exact equiv-
alent, equites aohites, is also found, eg. Liv. XXIII. 46, 12.
