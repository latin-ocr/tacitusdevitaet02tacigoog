mos t] noras calerna o. 71

26. quiete et otio: on this and a similar often recurrlng group
oi synonyme, see ch. 21, 26 ; 40, 9; 42, 9, and note Diui. 39, 28.
gnerus: to be joined to temporum.

2⁷. segnitia pro sapientia: with the thought, cp. Hier. Ι. 49,
sed claritas cautellam . . . obtentui, ut, quodomnium accasamentis
uocaretur. In Agricola, however, thc conditione were reversed.
idem. . . silentium: the meaning oi this statement, though cor-
rupted in the Mss, is clear. Agricola’s praetorship passed without
any features worthy oi record. The et is epexegetlc.

28. iurisdictio ε during the Empire, the number of praetore occa-
sionally rose as high as eighteen‚ but only the praetor urbanus aud
praetor pereyriaus possessed ex officio civil iurisdiction. The absence
of these judicial iunctione, therefore, still further accounts ior the
inconspicuous character oi Agricola's incumbency of the office.
ludos . . . duxit: a Tacitean coinage modeled upon pompam
(sanas) ducere, and employed to avoid the stereotyped phrase ludos
socero. This tendency to diseard the trite and commonplaoe is one of
the most significant features oi Tacitean style. Cp. Iatrod. p. xxxv.

29. inania honoris: with iaculo supply cetero, ior the ludi are
included among these. Translate : aad what other empty poyeaatry os
the office thera coos. medlo moderationis: ie. these gamos he
conducted on a scale midway between economy and extravagancc. —
The genitive with medius is chiefly poetic. In Tacitus again, Aac. Ι.
64, medio montium et paludum.

³0. uti. . . ita=qaomqaom—tamea. This adversative use oi
art-ito is especially frequent in Livy and Tacitus. lamae propior:
ie. he came nearer to acquiring distinction in this matter than one
would have expectedbeoause reckless extravagance in fumishing

amusement to the pcople was the time-honored method oi gaining
' popularity. The statement imnishes a good illustration oi Tacitus‘s
skill in turning to his hero's credit what was at best an indifferent
perlormance.

Page'd. 1. dona, etc: probably this refers to temple property
carried away by private individuale during the great fire under Nero,
who had himself replenished his own losses by depleting the temples
throughout the empire oi their art treasures. These latter were now
beyond restitution‚ but the others were collected with such success
that the commonwealth no more ielt their absence than ii they had
never been removed. This idea is impllcd iu the pluperiect. Fora
