such rivalry, 101 0 good wife iulfiils her one supreme mission in life
by being such, whereas a man’s sphere of noble achievement is 001
restricted to the home circle. Tacitus doubtless intended this as 0
gallant eompliment to his mother-in-law, who may well have still been
living when this biography was published.

18. salvium Titianum: L. Saluius Otho Titianus, brother 01
Otho, the future emperor, was consul in 11 and again in 69, proconsul
in ossas. After the death 01 Otho, 110000001100000101010011000010

19. dedit: sc. ei. The ellipsis 01 the demonstrative pronounis
particularly common 10 Tacitus. Iatrod. p. xxxi. neutro=ueutra
r'e. So Aua. 111. 15, 00110. A usage especially frequent 10 post-¹
Augustan Latin. See Diui. 19, 8, omatibus.

20. perata peccantibus: aprovince was often regarded asa
legitimare field 101 extortion and personal aggrandizement. To have
resisted so strong a temptation waS, therefore, 0 special proof 0100110-
ola's integrity. The praise here accorded 10 Agricola is, however,
somewhat inconsistent with ch. 9, ll f. -Esset must be supplied 01101

Tacitus has here, in order 10 emphasize the honesty of his hero, been
guilty 01 0 slight suppressio ueri, 101 Agricola served the greater part
01 his quaestorship under L. Antistius Vetus, proconsul 01 Asia for
beslii, a lofty character, as appears from Tacitus himself, in Aua.

24. inter quaesturam, 01οι ie. artuum inter quaesturam, 010,
the incongruity being due to the author's desire 10 avoid the awkward
repetition 01 annus. Ι1 seems that in the regular cursus honorum
an interval 01 one year was required between each 01 the offices here
mentioned. The tribuneship of Agricola would, therefore, 1011 10 the
year 66 and the praetorship 1068, the year of Nero’s death.
