70 nn. Later he incurred the displeasure oi Vespasian by his un·
compmmising opposition and was finally executed in 73 Μ).

20. saevitum: ecesse. triumviris: sc. capitalibus, the official
executioners. The delegation oi the duty oi burning condemned books
to these iunctionaries instead oi to the aediles was intended as an
additional degradation. —The earliest recorded instance oi this prac-
tice is the burning oi the alleged books oi Numa in 181 ac. Dun'ng
the empire such penalties were not uncommon. The biographies
mentioned by Tacitus were the last so dealt with, the inefficacy oi the
proceeding having gradually become apparent.

21. comitio ac loro: the comitium was situated north oi the
sorum and was the usual place ior punishments. The apparently
pleonastic soro is added to emphasize the publicity oi the transaction.
So Plin. N. H. XV. 18, 20, 77. It corresponds to ia conspectu popuii
oi Liv. XL. 29, 14, iibri irt comitio. . . ia c. p. cremati suat.

Paga 2. 2. conscientiam: Domitian in his shortsightedness
imagined he could prevent men from retaining a vivid knowledge oi
these events. Cp. Tae. Aac. IV. 35, praesenti potentia creduut eu-
tincas· posse etiam scortantis ceci memorium.

3. expulsis sapientiae professoribus: this took place in 93 nn.
-sapieritice, ior philosophice. Tacitus whimsically avoids, as iar as
possible, Greek expressions. So likewise, eg. philosophi and poeto. —
professor isa post-Augustan word. ——Tacitns is fond oi closing aperiod
with an ablativa absolute. Cp. Iatrcd. p. xxvii, and on the chiasmus,
ibid. p. xxviii. ,

4. atque is epexegetic oi the preceding clause, i.e. aad bp so doiap
be buaisbed eoerp wortlip accompiislimeat. This high praise oi phi-
losophy does not represent T's personal convictione, for it strangely
eontrasts with ch. 4, 15 ff. (where see note). It seems here to be due
to a desire to stigmatize· an aot oi Domitian at any price, ior Vespa—
sian, styled by Tacitus patientissimus ceri, had previously issued a
similar decree. ,

5. Dedimus proiecto: the asseverative particle is generally omitted
in Tacitus, when the verb is placed at the beginning. Cp. Iatrod.
p. xxvi.

6. vetus aetas: ie. the Republican period. This use oi cetus
is characteristic oi Tacitus.

7. nos: sc. uidimus. So ultimum aiter quid, and esset aiter serci-
tute are supplied irem the preceding by an easy ellipsis.
