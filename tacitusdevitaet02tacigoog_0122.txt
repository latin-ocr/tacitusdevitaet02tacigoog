mee 15] novus. 0111011114. 103

The imperfect is here used ior the pluperiect, because tho Roman
Α principle 01 completely subjugating what was in reach still held good.
inventus: sc. erat, not esset, ior, although the subjunctive oi esse is
frequently omitted, when another subjunctive has preceded (cp.
Introd. p. xxxii), the rhetorical use 01 the indicative in the apodosis
01 conditional clauses contrary to 1101 isone 01 the characteristic iea-
tures 01 Tacitean syntax. Here it marks an emphatic contrast to the
unreality 01 the protasis, which in all like instaures, except Hist. IV.
19, precedes.

28. clota et Bodotria: the Fritlis 01 Olyde and Fora, the line
itseli stretching approximately from Greenooic (near Glasgow) to
Edinbarph. diversi: opposite. See note ch. 11, 8. per ln-
mensum = per magnum spatium. Such expressions are exceedingly
common in Tacitus. See note ch. 10, 13.

29. spatio: strip. About 10 miles.

30. omnis propior sinus: tlte entire streteit os territory aeorer to
las, ie. the southern portions previously occupied hythe Romans.
Fora similar meaning 01 sinus, here including the west coast and part
oi the interior, op. Germ. 37, 26.

31. velutin aliam insulam: eliam skilliully marks the transition

to the next chapter, dealing with Ireland. 11 Caledonia had been .

meant here, Tacitus would have said velut in insulam. With firmavit
and tenebatur the author indicates that the Caledonian campaign in
the west was satisfactorily closed, and, as a matter oi 1101, the subse-
quent soene 01 the conflict is shiited 10 the east.

Ohapter 24. 32. Quinto.. .anno: 82nm. nave prima
uanegressus: crossiny over (viz. to Ireland) sor tlte Jirst time witi
ofleet. Ii, as is generally assumed, the fieet coasted northward along
the shore, transgresses would be out oi place. Prima is here, as
oiten, ag. Germ. 43, t, used adverbially, and its position, while
bringing it in juxtaposition with the verb, at tbe same time empha-
sizes the significance oi the achievement. The name Ireland occurs
first in Pytheas ; Caes, B. G. 13, 2, also mentions the island, and sub-
sequently many references to it, often curious, occur, but it cannot .
be said 10 have been definitely known till the time 01 Ptolemaeus, the
famous geographer 01 the second century an. Agricola, 11 we except
occasional tradere, seems to have been, in iaci, the first Roman to set
1001 upon Ireland, nor was it again invaded in Roman times, The
point 01 departure cannot be accurately determined. See map.
