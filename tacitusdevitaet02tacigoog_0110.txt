28. Quantulum: like quantas quisque, hon seeo. The diminutive
here emphasizes the relative smallness oi the enemy's number when
compared to their multitudes.

29. Sic: ie. in the same way as we shall do now. Germanias:
ii the allusion, as is likely, is to the defeat oi Vama by Arminius in
9 nn, the plural is rhetorical for Germaniam inferiorem, which would
have been too cumbrous and pedentie.

³1. et = et praeterea. cp. note ch. ll, t. causas: incentives.

32. Divus Iulius: even Caesareae to retreat, ped theoph lte be.
For a similareareesm, cp. Ann. Ι. 09, ille inter numina dicetne Angue-
tne. Here the irony is somewhat out oi place, as Dicae could not
refer to an act oi the living Caesar ; but ao Caesar is called dimeter
hyan analogous anachronism in the passage cited below. Recensu-
τοο. . . aemularentur: supply respectively Romanoa and Britanni.
These different subiects would be more clearly designated in direct

correetly says, solitum quidem Britannis seminarunt ducta bellare,
’ for the evidence aveilable seems to make against the assumption oi
female rulers among Celtic tribes, except in rare instantes, and Taci-
tus himself (Genu. 45, 30 f.) mentions the custom as a prooi oi the
low and servile characteres the Germanic Sitones. sumpsere . . .
bellum: a Sallustian expression, copied irom' Thucydides, eg. ΙΙΙ.
