an *0.ἰ So perhaps also 37, 22, 1011100, sed for tumes 01, as suggested
by Halm.

31,16. in patientiam bellaturi] inpoenitentium arma laturi—
Wex; inpoenitentium laturi—MSS.-The emendation of Wett ie by
iar the simplest 01 the many suggested, and is highly satisfactory in
sense. Ican see no force in Woelfflin's obiection that the Britons had
already taken up arms, and could not, therefore, be saidlctari. Nor
can I understand why Tacitus (ae F. ad loc. maintains) should heve
ebrunk from using a perfectly intelligible phrase like arma serre in

, paenitentiam. Paenitentiam might of course bercgardedesthefalse

solution oi the compendium lor patientiam, which, be 11 observem
isnot iound in the MSS.; but even it it were, the former would be
the dtyietlior 100110, because e lees commonplace‚ and therefore a
more Tacitean, antithesis to libertatem then patientiam. We shall
take up arms against the Romane, says Calgacus, in the hope 01000111-
ing our liberty, and notin the expectationof having ever ιο regret
the attempt, as was the case with the Brigantes.

32, 9. alle: possibly this represents the compendium for 0110110, a
reading highly euitablc to the context, but see note 11010 ad loc.

33, 1. vincte vestra] uirtute et—MSS.-Peter alone of recent
’ editors has defended the traditional reading, but Ι cannot accept his
reasons. imperium Romanurn does not merely represent the substitu-
tion of an abstract 1011110 concrete, but is clearly a personification used
ιο avoid the mention oi Domitian, ior the successes referred 10 belong .
ior the chief part in the reign 01 that emperor, Peter erroneously sup
poeing thet the abstract was employed οο as to include Vespasium
Titus, and Domitian. The Empire once personified, 11 was as natural
as it was legitimate to predicate virtus, or any other quality of it.
See also note ed loc. lbere, therefore, had no hesitation in restoring
the reading 01 the MSS.

33, 9. montesve] montesque-Urlichs. The suggestion oi an
alternative ie quite out of place, the aim of the speaker being to give
a cumuletive eiiect in the enumerationes the hardsbips the Roman
soldier had overcome. The collocation, paludes montesque 01 flattina,
10, moreover, exceedingly common in Tacitus, -ve -et, not being found
atall. Cp. note ch. 12, 3. ' ,

33, 11. aclea] veniunt-Schoene; animus—MSS. Dare aciem
occurs only in Val. Flacc. V. 611, end should, therefore, not have been
forced upon T. 00010111, though not a certain emendation, gives an
excellent sense and is methodically as iustilieble as 00100.
