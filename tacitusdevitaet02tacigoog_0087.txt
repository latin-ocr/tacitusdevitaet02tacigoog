adprobabit: i.e. he served his military apprenticeship so as 10 win
the approvai 01 his chief. On the conciseness 01 expressionem
Iatred. p. xxxiii. electus: in place 01 the participle, we should cx·
pect a finite verb, as the approbation cannot have followed the selec-
tion. For an analcgous eliminaticn 01 the temporal 10100 01 the
perfect participle, 000 note ch. 29, 21, ictas .. . 0101011.

25. contubernio aestimaret: 10. having been selected by Pau·
linus to test his worth by tenting with him-coatuberrtr'o is an
instrumental ablativa, as in Hor. Epist. II. 1, 48, uirtutem aestimet
00010. 110οε000000. licenter. . . segniter, ete: ie. neither
lieentiously, 010, nor owing 10 slothfulness did he take advantage 01
his titular tribuneship, 010, 10 secure through iurloughs opportunities
ior enjoyment. The et aiter voluptates is epexegetic. See Iatrod.

28. noscere . . . nosci, ete: Tacitus repeatedly joins the active,
and passive 01 the same verb, eg. Germ. 19, conrumpere et corrumpi.
-Observe the 01111111 balaneing 01 clauses and the accumulation 01
seven historical infinitives. In eh. 19, 2911. we have eight, in ch. 38,
1611. ten. This number is rarely exceeded. exercitui: on the
subjective dative, see note, eh. 2, 11.

Paga 4. 2. anxius: 0001100010. In this sense the word is ἅπαξ
εἱρημένον. Agricola never underestimated the strength 01 the enemy,
an attitude which he owed to the training 01 Paulinus. See note ch.
t, 24.-On the adj. :adv., seo Diei. 4, 16. excitatior: more
epitcted.

4. coloniae: there was only one colony, Camulodunum, the mod-
ern Colchester. The poetical plural is here used, as in 21, 21, temple,

applies to intercepti coercitas, the allusion being apparently to the
defeat 01 the ninth legion—On the 10100 01 the asyndeton, see
Iatrod. p. xxvii. tum de salute, etc. r the antithesis seems 10 have
been a eommonplaee. cp. 26, 18 ; Caes. Β. O. 111, 5; Plut. Caes. to.
