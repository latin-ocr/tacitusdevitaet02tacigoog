V.
STYLE AND Rnr‘roalc. ,

Tacitus is not only the greatest historian whom Rome.
produced, but he is also one of the greatest stylistic artists
in the world's literature.

Equipped with the most thorough rhetorical training
which his time afforded (and without such, it must be remem-
bered, 110 ancient author, least oi all in the postAugustan
age, could hope for recognition or an abiding renown),
Tacitus began his career as a writer with the brilliant
Dialogus cle oratoribus. This exhibita the youthful author
still completely under the spell of the exuberant diction oi
Cicero,aretur11to whose style Quintilian, Tacitus's great
teacher, advocated with lifelcng enthusiasm, to offset the
corrupting influence of Seneca. Nearly twenty years were
to elapso before Tacitus broke the silence imposed by the
despotism of Domitian with the publication of the Agricola.
The great difference which confronts us in the style of the
two treatises is easily accounted for, but only one of the
causesl calls for special mention here.⁴ The exigencies of
artistic prose imperatively demanded a distinctly different
treatment ior each species ot literary composition, a his-
tory, an encomium, a speech, or a letter exhibiting a stylis·
tic type peculiarly distinct. Now, when Tacitus designed
the Agricola, he conformed tc existing rhetorical canons for
the βασιλικὸς λόγος, cr biographical eulogy, as we have seen,
but forits stylistic framework he selected as his model
the historiar Sallust? And certainly Sallust's ‘immortal
swiftness,’ his epigrammatic directness and general sty-

auctor, with which estimate Martial, Tacitus's contemporary, fully
agrees. Op. Bk. XIV. 191, Primis Romana crispus ia historia.
