Chapter 31. 7. voluit = decrerit. So often3 with natura per-
sonifled, eg. Val. Max. VII. 1, 1; Quint. X. 3, 4. alibi: some-
where or other, not elsewhere, ior Calgacus cannot have meant to
exclude the Britieh auxiliarios in Britain itseli. See nota on aliquis
(ch. 38, 19). British cohorte are found eg. in the armies oi Caecina
and Vitellius, at the second battle 01 Bedriacum, in Pannonia, and
elsewhere, as we iearn from Tacitus’s Historias and inscriptione.

8. hostilem=hortiom. Tacitus often substitutes this and other
adJ'ectivesforthegenitive. Subiective ashere, eg. Ana. XIII. &Latinae
hostiles; Hist. ΙΙΙ, 77, clamore hostili. cp. also note Diei. 29, 21.

9. nomine amicorum etque hospitum: the thought is slightly
obscured by overconciseness, the implication being that the victims
were hythe false professione oi friendship and hospitahty first thrown
off their guard and then dishonored.

10. ageretque annue: their yearly harvest ,· canas alone in this
sense occure first in Cic. Verr. Ι. l, 14, 40. In prose again derra.
14, 1, but often in post-Augustan epic poetry, eg. Lucan. III. 70 ;
Stat. Theb. IX. 406. Aper is here added for the sake of balancing
the five other groups oi virtually synonymous expressions in this one
sentence. in frumentum, etc: with the sentiment, an oratorical
commonplaoe cp. ch. 19, eff, and the speech of Boudicca in Dio
Cass. LXII. 3.

11. emuniendis: ia the cleonae. atque . . . ac . . . ec . ..
ac: such accumulatione oi oc are extremely rare in Latin. cp. note
Diei. 17, 28.

12. inter verbera ac contumelias: contumelio has here the
concrete and restricted meaning of caffs in the sace, alapae, as distin-
guished from the generic term cerbero, blacos. Cp. Hist. III. 31,
praeberi os contumeliis ; 85, erepere os et offerre contumeliis. On the
combination, see Iatrod. p. irim—inter, ie. alternating between. So
similarly, ch. 32, 193 Hist. 1. 1, inter insessos vel obnoeios. con-
teruntur: used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, figurativer with bona fortunaeque and
uper atque annus, in its usual sense with corpora . . . monas. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxii. It is, therefore, not necessary to supply consumun-
ιον by zeugma. neta servituti: so eg. Cic. de proc. eoas. 5, 10 ior
the regular sosoi ad.

1³. semel veneunt, etc: cp. the words put into the mouth of
Boudicca by Dio Cass. l.c., πόσῳ κρεῖττον ἦν ἅπαξ τισὶ πεπρᾶσθαι
μᾶλλον ἣ μετὰ κενῶν ἐλευθερίας ὀνομάτων κατ’ ἔτος λυτροῦσθαι, evidently
