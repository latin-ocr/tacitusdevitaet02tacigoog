PREFAOE.

Wax’s edition of the Apricolo (1852) may be said to constitute
anew landmark in the philological labors devoted to the elucida
tion cf this biography. He incorporated what was still of value
in the work of his numerous predecessore, and added not a little
of his own to the improvement of the text and to a better under-
standing of its contente. Since his time the contributione made
to the criticism and exegesis of the A yricolo, and to Tacitus gen·
erally, have been very considerable, both in quality and quantity;

but while the historicah ethnclogical‚ and syntectical material Α

thus accumulated is satisfactorily exhaustive, the strictly rhetorical
features of the A yricola, conspicuous though they are, have hitherto
been persistently aud inexplicahly overlooked or ignored. And
yet it must be evident that a student can at best acquire buta
very superficial appreciation ol the consummate artistic merite of
this treatise if he remain in ignorauce of the vital elements that
make the Agricola the immortal masterpiece that it is.

Ihave‚ therefore, been at pains to illustrate and analyze, albeit
under the restrictione necessarily irnposed upon a college edition,
all noteworthy rhetorical features in the style and structure of the

Apricola, the synopsis in the Introduction being, for the reason '

given above, intentionally more full than might otherwise appear
warranted in anedition of this nature. The discovery that Taci-
tuS, in writing the A yricolo, closely followed time-honored rhetori·
cal canons for biographical composition was as great a surprise to
me, who had once denied this on the basis of an exarnination of ·
extant classical biographies, as it will doubtless be to others. I
hope, however, that the necessarily briei review ol the evidence
given in the Introduction will suffice to carry conviction.

In the Notes I have endeavored to face every real difficulty and
Ι to omit no comment, wherever such would be welcome to the

young student, and I trust that no wholly irrelevant matter has
