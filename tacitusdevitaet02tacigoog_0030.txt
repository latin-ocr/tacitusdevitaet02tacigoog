were, as we have seen, largely, if not wholly, works of the
oreative imagination.

Το what extent, finally, books, if any, were consulted for
the account of the etbuolopy and yeopropby¹ of Britain, it is
impossible to determine. Tacitus himself was certainly
acquainted with the most important works dealing with
these topics, for he singles out Isioy and Fabius Rusticus
as the most famous out of many accessible to him,2 assur-
ing us that their information was scanty and unreliabie, he
being in possession of more authentia details, Caesar,
whom Tacitus stylos summus auctorum in the Germanic
(011. 28, 5), seems not to have been consulted, or rather he
was intentionally ignored, for he cannot be included among
those who noudum comperta eloquentia percoluere (oh. 10, 4),
0 statement in no sense applicable to the short paragraphs
which Caesar has devoted to the subject.³

That he made direct use of any Greek sourceS, such as
Pytheas of Massilia, Strabo, Diodorus, or even Posidonius,
whose works on physioal geography and ethnology marked
the highest point which scientific research into these subjecta
reached iu antiquity, is extremely doubtful, for Tacitus’s
explanatione of the long days and the tides are unsoientifi03
and in holding to the disk·shaped form of the earth, he is
deplorably behind the knowledge even of his own time.

had cavalry as well as chariot fighters, whereas Tacitus mentions only
the latter, whom he calls cocianurtt, ior which Caesar says essedarii.
But the contradiction is, perhaps, only apparent, sor 'l‘acitus is speak-
ing of the Caledoniam, Caesar cf the Britons in Kent, and what was
true oi the latter was uot ueceaarily applicable to the former.
