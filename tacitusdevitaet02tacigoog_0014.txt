date oi his death is altogether unknown, but it cannot have
been earlier than 116 an, as may be inferred from an allu-

Writings.—If we except the youthiul but brilliant Dic·
loyua and numerous speeches which the distinguished orator

doubtless published from timeto time, according to the
prevailing custom, Tacitus's illustrious career as a writer
begins with the Agricola, which appeared shortly after the
death oi Nerva (J an. 27, 98 nn), although the entire work,
with the exceptiones the prooemium (1-3) and one passage
at the close,s may well have been composed immediately
after the death oi Domitian.

In the same year there followed the Germanic, the date
being fixed by oh. 37, 5 ff. oi that work.

The Historias, announced as in contemplation in the Apri-
eolo (ch. 3, 28-30), appeared between 105-109. They com·
prised the story of the reigns oi Galba, Otho, Vitellius,
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, but only the first four
books and a fragment of the fifth, dealing with the year
69-7 0, have survived.

The Annulo began with the death of Augustus, and con-
cluded with the assassination oi Nero in 68 an. Only
bks. I.-IV., portions of V. and VI, and bks. XI.-XVI. are
preserved, the entire narrative of the reign oi Caligula,
the beginning of that of Claudius, and the end of Nero's
being lost.

⁸ Ch. 44, 4-11 has all the appearance of an afterthought, it being in
the nature oi a vaticinium post eventum, and ch. 45, 12, non vidit,
etc, it seems, would very appropriately have followed immediately
aiter potest. .. effugisse. The absence oi the epithet dions in
ch. 3, 13 need not imply that Nerva was still living when these words
were penned. See noteadloc.
