9. semineces ior semivivos is a Vergilian word, frequent in post
Augustan poetry, but very rare in prose; ag. Liv. XXHI. 15, 8 and
Tac. Hist. III. 28. In Greek, on the other hand, the very opposite
usage obtains, nutris being quite common, whereas intrans ts not
found at all, except in very late writers.

10. equitum=equ0rurn‚ sc. Britanorum. Here equivalentto equi
siae rectoribus (see below). This conlimion Is met with as early as
Ennius, 237 V. quadrupes eques, and was imitated by Verg. deora. ΙΙΙ.

tive (impellerentur) is tha Roman cavalry.

12. recentem terrorem: c sreslt source asponis, in addition to
that inspired by the victorious infantry. -The same phrase occurs
repeatedly. Cp. also note ch. 32,18. densis. . . haerebant:
