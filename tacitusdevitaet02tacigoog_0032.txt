STYLn ΑΜ) RHETORIO. XXV

110110 originality‚ may vvell have exerted a powerful 111110-
tion upon a mind such as Tacitus's. But, at the same time,
he seems 10 have been captivated bytho nohility 01 Ver-
901011 diction.. In the Historias and Anatole he 10 some
extent emancipated himself from the style 01 Sallust, but
the influence 01 the great poet never waned, remaining con· ’
spiouously in evidence in all his vvorhs.

In the 1191100101 these two streams still blond in happy
harmony, producing a style as 111 removed from the ‘milhy
richness' 01 the Dialogus 10 11 10 from the succinctness of
expression in the Historia, or the still greater conciseness
01 the Aauuls. But a man of such literary gifts as Tacitus
is never a mere imitator, and hence we find that certain
features characteristic 01 his mature and developed style
already appearin the Agricola, his earliest treatise 01 au
historical character. The most noteworthy 01 these are a
straining 101 the utmost brevity, which occasionally resulted
in obscurity, and a deliberate avoidanoe 01 the commonplace,
the trite, or formulaic, which led him 10 coin nevv expres-
sions, orto give a novel turn 10 0111 ones.

The following survey aims 10 give in a conveniently tabu·
. lated form a collection 01 the most interesting stylistio and
