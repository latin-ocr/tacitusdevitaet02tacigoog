18. Suebis . . . Frisiis: Suebi, according to Tac. uem. 38, was,
a collective designation ior many tribes who occupied the greater part
oi Germany and led a more or less nomadio llie; hence their name,
which means nanderers. A Suebic offshoot was settled by Augustus
in Flendus, and these are the people probably alluded to here. The
Frisii occupied the territory a little to the southwest‚ stretohing irorn
the eastern mouth oi the Rhine to the Erus.

19. ln nostram usque ripam: ie. the leit bank oi the Rhine.
This proves that Tacitus conceived the Usipi to have sailed irom the
west around scotland, ior on any other supposition the adventurers
would have reached the Roman boundary before they were ship-
, wrecked and captured by the more northern Suebi and Ihisians.
mutatione ementium: commercial eucbuuye.

20. inlustravit: the indicative aiter suni qui occurs oecasIonally
in poetry, but is extremely rare in prose. In Tacitus again Diui.
37, 27, suut apud quoe . . . rueretur. Here a certain number oi the
Usipi are specially singled out from the rest.

Ohapter 29. 21. Inliio aestatis: the seventh summer, 84 nn.

ictus . . . amielt: striot logio would require ictus esi, filio clauso,
but the participle and finite verb have a tendency to interchange their
iunctione, particularly when the two acts are virtually coincident.
The construction is a Graecism; eg. Xen. Auub. IV. 8, rt 3 Pind.
Nem. VIII. 38. Frequently in Latin poetry, ag. Lucret. V. 514; Hor.
Germ. III. 6, 33; Lucan, VII. 581, but in prose ch, t, 24, and Anu.
IV. 64 seem to be the only other analogous instances. .

23. plerique tortium virorum ambiriose: i.e. unlike many
bravo men, Agricola did not ostentatiously display his sorroW, orribi-
ie'ose being oiten used in this sense. Hitherto plerique sortium uiro-
rum, etc, was taken in an ironicul sense, with direct reference to the
Stolos, but this is incompatible with the antithesis in muliebriter, nor
does Tacitus elsewhere ridicule the Stolos for not practicing the ἀτα-
ραξία which they preached. , On this truly Roman attitude, op. Cic.
Tusa. Disp. II. 21, 49; Lucan, viii, 617, and Tac. Anu. III. 6.
per lamenta . . . maerorem: words denoting pain or sorrow are
frequently combined in synonymic groups. Here the first more par·
ticularly expresses open, the second silent sorrow.

24. in luctu bellum, etc: a similar conduct is attributed to
Alexander (Plut. Alex. 72) and Tiberius (Aac. IV. 8). nuens =
ou ibe other barud. See note ch. 20, 19.
