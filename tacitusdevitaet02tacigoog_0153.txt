was a peculiarly imperial characteristic, to which a mere subject
ought never to lay claim, for its possession involved an eminence too
exalted to be overlooked, besides suggesting odious comparisons with
an emperor so lacking in this very quality as Domitian. -On the
predicative position of the attributive, see Introd. p. xxv.

16. exercitam: uroayht ap by arech reflectione. quodque . . .
erat: in apposition with the following clause.

17. secreto suo satiatus: i.e. having fully indulged in his char-
acteristic secret broodings over this matter. — Note the alliteration. —
With the statement itself, cp. Plin. Paaey. 48, inmanissima bellac

the transition to the next chapter, dealing with the events immedi-

text, is not expressly mentioned. The motives for Domitian’s conduct
here given must not be accepted without some allowanee. Agricola
had been governor of Britain for a longer period than any oi his pred-
ecessore. His campaigns were very expensive and yielded no com-
