synonymous expressions occurring with constantly decreasing fre-
quency from the Dictoque to the second part of the Arcucis, see
Introd. p. xxia-On the brachylogy in this sentence, see Iutrod.
p. xxxiii. celeberrimus quisque ingenio=clurissiucu iupeuia.
Iuycuiuruis not used in the singular in a personal sense, hence celc-
berra‘ruum 00011000 ingenium was impossible here. Oelebcr = clarus

opponent, was born 162 nc, and died about 89 ac. His autobicgra-

ch. 29, 243 Germ. 19, conrumpere et conrumpi‚· Aua. II. 10.
