which is notcworthy, for the very nature of things would
prompt the insertion oi these topics at the beginning, but
rather the many parallelisms in details, thus suggesting
traditional rhetorical models.

3. Ἐπιτηδεύματα. They are defined by Menander1 as ἄνευ
ἀγώνων ἤθη, and it does not seem accidental that by far the
larger number of ethical or personal traits of Agricola is
· accumulated in the very next chapters in accordance with
the rhetorical rules, and that there is, in fact, scarcely one
of these characteristica which is not paralleled in Hermoge
nes, Theon, Menander, and others.²

4. Πράξεις. The next topic of the biographical encomium
is the πράξεις or achievements of the hero‚³ but in the Agricola
there follow ch. 10-13, dealing with the ethnology and
geography of Britain. Thus it might seam that those who
declared this to be an irrelevant episode could now even
appeal to the laws of rhetoric as confirmatory of their view,

but here another passage in Menander happily comesto our
rescue which fully vindicatos the discussion of these very
subjects under this head,⁴ a passage the more significant,

ψυχῆς αυτοῦ διεξελθεῖν (= ch. 418 f. flagrantem animum, etc.) ε’νῷ
ε’ρεΐς τὴν φιλομάθειαν. . . τὴν περὶ τὰ μαθήματα σπουδὴν. . . κᾶν μὲν ἒν
λύγοις ἦ καὶ φιλοσοφίᾳ . . . τοῦτο ἐπαινέσεις (=ch.4, 18. 15. 18).
