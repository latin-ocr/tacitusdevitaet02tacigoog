been allowed to intrude. In not burdeniug the commentary with
scrupulous acknowledgment for every real obligation incurred,
imperative as this would be in an edition intended ior scholars, Ι
have ventured to follow a well-recognized precedent. Nor have
, Ι, ior reasons 01 brevity‚ called attention, except in aiew instances,
to the existence of other interpretatione than those, whether new
or old, which I deenred sufficiently convincing to warrant accept
auce. Under these circumstances I gladly take this opportunity
of saying that, 01 all the editions accessible 10 me, I have found
those oi Wex, Peter, Andresen, and Furneaux especially helpful
and suggestive; and Ι only regret that, having profited so much
by their labors, I should have been compelled to dissent irorn
their views so frequently, though I hope never without valid
reasons. That I have again mede every possible use 01 the ad-
mirable Lexioon Taciteum, unfortunately not yet finished, will be

· evident from my Notes. ⁸

The text has been subjected to a thorough revision, and may
claim to represent an independent recension. It differs from that
ol Halm⁴ in nearly sixty instances, the justification 01 these devia-
110οε being given, as briefly as possible, ina Critical Appendix.
It is a matter 01 grem regret that l had to be deprived 01 11ιο
benefit which the third known Ms. of the Agricola, discovered by
Dr. R. Wuensch in Toledo, might have proved to be for the con-
stitution 01 a better text than is now possible. But the most
strenuous efforts to secure a copy, photograph, or collation have
been alike uuavailing, owing to the unfortunate attitude of the
prolate of Toledo, who, though incapable of reading the ΜΒ.
himself, has absolutely prohibited its inspection, 00 the ground
that a Ms. once made known loses all its value.

In conclusion, I have again the pleasure 01 acknowledging with
gratitnde the most welcome and valuable aid which my old friends,
Professor John cnolle 01 the University 01 Michigan and Pro
sessor Cbarles Ε. Bennett 01 Cornell University, have so ungrudg·
ingly given to this book in its passage through the prese. ’
