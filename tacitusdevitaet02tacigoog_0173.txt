ORITIOAL APPENDIX.

Tun deviations from the text oi Halm4 here noted follow the
bracket- 0. R. refers to my Notos to tlte Ayctcolc in the Classical
Rccicw, vol. XI. (1897), pp. anesca-F. to Furneaux’s edition,
Oxiord, 1898. -Α(Γ> = Vat. 3429; Β(Δ) = vat. 4498.

Chapter 3, line 12. set] et-MSS. Sec F. ad loc.

4, 16. ultraquam] ultraque quam-Baehrens. cp. Ο. R. 325.

4,17. ao senatori] (cosenatori). cp. O. R. 325. Andrescn (and
F. isdisposed to agree with him) has objected to this deletion on the
ground that senatori may be taken in an anticipatory sense, as in Dici.
28, 3, principes liberos (destined to be leaders) and Aac. III. 59, rcc-
torem pencris humaui (the future ruler). This explanation would be
acceptabis ii the text read accensuit, expressive oi the highest attain-
able goal, as in the examplcs just citcd; but to reach senatorial rank
was certainly no conspicuous achievement‚ and its mention immedi-
ately upon Romano is in the nature oi an anti-climax.

6,18. 20. proconsule. . . pro consule] proconsulem . ..
proconsul.

6, 27. tenor] laertior-MSS. No satisfactory emendation oi this
admittedly corrupt reading has yet been proposed. Tener (Rhena
nus) gives a tolerable sense, but it is paleographically out ot the ques-
tion, and the word does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus. cp. 0. R.
325.

6, 29. medlo rationis] medio moderationis. cp. 0. R. 326.

6, 2. effecit] fecit-MSS. Op. Cic. in Verr. V. 2, 53 Ovid, ca
Porti. Ι. 1, 65.

8, 23. dignum est: Tacitus elsewhere omits the copula after dip-
aumandiuctcnum. See dacto. Ihave now retained it with the
MSS. because the ellipsis oi the copula had not yet reached the pro
portions it had in the later writiugs. See Iatrod. p. xxxii. Possibly
also, as Andresen suggests, it may have been here designedly expressed
to prevent crat from being understood.
