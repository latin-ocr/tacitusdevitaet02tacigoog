here, successes. See note ch. 8, 30.

17. pensare (= conpensare, which does not occur in Tacitus) is
chiefly poetic and post-Augustam iuxta = pariter, neque. So
used in six other passages oi Tacitus, but in the smaller works only
here.

18. Agricola, etc: this seemingiy irrelevant paragraph is added
atthis particular point in the narrative, because the above-mentioned
successes were won at some distance from headquarters, and without
the general's previous knowledge or upon his initiative, a fact utilized
by the biographer to emphasize certain noteworthy qualities oi Agric-
ola, which this circumstance had revealed, and his readiness to
bestow praise in turn naturally leads to a briei statement conseming
his temper generally. cp. introcant. .

19. centurio . . . praelectus: officere oi the infantry and cav-
alry respectively. inconmptum . . . testem habebat: aseri to
find in him cn impartiat salinator (cpprce’ser) os his deed, testis
being here used in a very peculiar sense; ior this conduct was, oi
course, not confined to achievements which he actually witnessed, as
is clear from the context.

21. et=et cero,cnd in saci. Cp.ch.10,12. bonis . . . ad-
versus malos: on the change oi construction, characteristic oi Taci-
tus, see Intrcd. p. xxxiv. iniucundus: not elsewhere used in
Tacitus, and very rarely applied to persons; ag. Quint. X. 1, 124. -
With the statement, cp. Xen. Apes. ll, 10, πραότατός γε μὴν φίλοις ω’ν,
ἐχθροῖς φοβερώτατος ἣν.

22. secretum, etc: i.e. unlike ag. Domitian ¹(ch. 39, 17 ; 42, 20)
and Tiberius (Aac. I. 69, odic in loncnrn tenens poce reconderet
nmisque promeret), he gave expression to his indignation when in
anger, but did not secretly cherish any further resentment. ut
. . . timeres: ior the subjunctive, cp. ch. 12, 31, at internosces.

23. offendere . .. odisse: on the alliterative antithesis, op.
Irttrcd. p. xxviii.

Ohapter 23. 25. Quarta aestas: ie. 81 nn. obtinendis:
the final dative with gerundivo is very rare in the minor works. cp.

ch. 22, 9; 31, 11; 45, 22, and Germ. 11, 4.
2⁷. pateretur: on the singular predicate, see note ch. 4, 21. —
