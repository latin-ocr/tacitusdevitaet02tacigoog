cr edge of the disk-shaped earth. —The phenomenon oi the mid-
night sun is here given expressly on the authority ol others (adfirmant)
and, as a matter oi fact, it is not observed in even the most northerly
regions oi Caledonia. In Germ. 45, 27, it is more accurately ascribed
to Norwey.

Pege 9. 1. Scilicet, ete: this fanciiul and somewhat obscure
explanation was adopted by Tacitus from some earlier and unknown
pseudo-scientist. It implies the beliei, generally rejected even in an-
tiquity, that the earth was a circular shield or concava disk, the sun’s
shadow being supposed to cause night. On the presumably western,
unobstrueted edge (extremo et plana terraram) the shadcw cast would
below, falling iar beneath the heaven with its stars; at the center the
more extended curvatura oi the suriaco would proiect it to a somewhat
greater height, thus bringing on deeper darkness, while at the opposite
extremity there would be no shadow at all, or perpetual daylight.
extrema et plana: except in Sallust such substantival adiectives are
found in pre-Tacitean prose only ii they convey a partitive meaning.

2. caelum et sidera: on this collocation, see Introd. p. xxx.

3. praeter: caceptt'ap, acomparatively rare usage. In Tac. again:
Hist. V. 8, 10; Aac. Ι. 13; XIII. 19, 46. oleam vitemque et
cetera. . . sueta: every frequent collocation in Tacitus, 11111111-
ing a group, followed by an independent clement with et. In this
treatise again, ch. 26, 24.

4. terris: the ablativa cf place where, though extremely common
in Tacitus, is still rare in the minor writings. Cp. eg. ch. 25, 24 ;
33, 22 ; 45, 3; Diui. 13, 21. oriri sueta: so Sall. Hist. froom. 1, 9.
lrugmn petiens, iocundum: ytalus, or rather abcondo in fruita,
exeepting such as grow only in warmer elimatas, like that oi Italy. —
secundam is added asyndetically tc qualiiy potiens, which is at best
avague term and therefore liable to convey a false impression. -With
the phrase, cp. eg. Lucan, IX. 857, impatiensque sclam Cereris.

⁵. tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt: an adversative, notan
enumerative asyndeton which would involve an uncalled for hysteron
proteron. So exactly eh. 3, 19. —procenioat cannot here signiiy
yrowiay antististite (its usual meaning, with fruges and the like), ior
this would be incompatible with tarde mitescunt ,· but it is used in the
very rare sense oi comino forth, sprooticp, ag. Plaut. Cape. lI. l, 26
(vs. 223); Tac. Hist. IV. 65.
