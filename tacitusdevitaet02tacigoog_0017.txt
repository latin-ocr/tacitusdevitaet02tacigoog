Biography, according to all our ancient authorities, be·
longs to the epideictic branch of literary composition, in
particular the encomium, and its rules are illustrated, as
was natural, in connection with the biography of a king,
the socalled βασιλικὸς λόγος,1 the rhetoricians usually citing
as typicat models the still extant Agesilaus of Xenophon and
the Eunporus of Isocrates.² That the Agricola partakes oi
the character of an encomium, a merely cursory perusal could
have confirmed, even it Tacitus had not expressly told us so
himseli.³ In fact, the line of demarcation between a his-
torical narrative and an encomium was a very slight οναο,4

The constituent parts of a regularly constructed encomium
are the following:⁵ 1. προοίμιον. 2, γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή.

These precepta present a stereotyped sameness, being often reproduced
verbatim from earlier handbooks, and they are, one and all, ulti· ¹
mately derived irom treatises reaching back oi our era. The Romans

· developed no rhetorical systems of their own, but began in the days

of Cicero and therealter with ever-increasing assiduity to copy and
follow the rhetorical canons of the Greeks. For a brief account ol
the above rhetoricians and others, see Christ, Griectischc Literutur·
geschichte ⁸, pp. 752 ff.

1 That its essential features are common to biographical writing in
general might have been taken for granted, even ii Menander (libet.
Graec. III. 369, 25 Sp. IX. 215 f. W.) had not expressly confirmed it:
οὐ ’γὰρ ἴδιον τοῦτο μόνον τοῦ βασιλέως τὸ ἐγκώμιον, ἀλλὰ κοινὸν πρὸς
πάντας τοὺς οἰκοῦντας τὴν πόλιν.
