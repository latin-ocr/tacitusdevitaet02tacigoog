with soldiers or foreigners ; later authors use itin the sense oi clients,
or oi the upper classes, as distinguished irom the tunicati (= plebs).

he had had legal training. Iam vero: besides, scribermcre ; a ior-
mula oi transition, usually emphatic, occurring occasionally in Tacitus.

- curarum remissionumque: also combined in Dici. 28, 27 i.

12. ubi. . . poscerent: the subjunctive oi repeated action with
abi, occurs only here in the minor werke, though common in the His·
tories and Annols and in post-Augustan writers generally. con-
ventus ac iudicia: circuit coorta. Iudicia is added aa the more
specific term ior the sake oi nearer definitior, according to a charac-
teristic usage in Tacitus. See Iatrod. p. xxx.

13. st saepius misericors: sc. erat. On et, cad ct tte sometime,
besides, aiter an asyndeton, see Intrcd. p. xxviii. and Hist. IV. 12,
erat et domi delectas eques; with saepius as here, eg. Aac. III. 74,
pars aitqua militia Romani t'rt ore, in latere et saepius a tergo erat. -

morosenesa aad hauteur cred ccvetoasreesa. The figure, common in
Tacitus, is taken from a dress, which can he put off or on at pleasure.
strictly speaking, he, as Apriecla, could not, oi course, cast cii what
he never had; but Tacitus means to say that as legatas he had divested
himself, the moment he entered upon this office, oi all those qualities
which the Romans from time immemorial had come to regard as
inseparable irom it. The ambiguity was due to a striving ior con·
crseness.

16. facilitas: effability, when not acting in an official capacity,
and with the implication that he was easily accessible. So again
ch.40,10.

17. integritatem . . . luerit: with the sentiment, cp. Vell. Pat.
