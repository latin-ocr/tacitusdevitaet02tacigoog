150 uorns. 0111191911. [1109 91

This matchless epilogue (ch. 45, 2511), 90 11111 01 piercing teudcrness
and solemn eloquence, is in iis reflectione 10 9 large extent made up 01
well-known and 011911 recurring rhetorical commonplaces, but such
is the consummate art 01 Tacitus that he has nevertheless hreathsd a
new originality into horrowed material, and at the same time suc-
ceeded in creating the indelihle impression 01 9 spontaneous and
deeply sincere cutburst 01 sorrow and affection. See also lotroci.

27. constans et libens: with coarope aad cheersaloess.

28. iatum excepisti: Tacitus has some thirty phrases 101 death
and dying, he being fond 01 working variatione upon commonplace
expressions. Cp. in this treatise, ch. 1,14; 2,18; 3, 19. 24; ὁ, 3;

giving the inierence 01 others (l. 27), according to Tacitean usage,
on which see note ch. 15, 19, 19 based more particularly upon libeas,
101 9 men such as Agricola must he assumed 10 have met death
coactans, even 11 there had been no suspicion 01 ioul play. That he
should hy his manner have given the impression oi exonerating Domi-
tian would he quite in accord with his character, as drawn in this
treatiee. pro virili portione: apparently a new coinage to avoid
the hackneyed pro virili porte (not in Tacitus). The phrase occurs
also Hist. ΙΙΙ. 20, but is generally very rare. Cp. Iatrod. p. xxv.

30. erepti: the use 01 9 perfect passive participle for an abstract
