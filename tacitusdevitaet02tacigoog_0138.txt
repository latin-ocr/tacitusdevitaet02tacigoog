common in Tacitus. Cp. eg. Dial. 8, left, ceteros quidem amicos
. . . Marcellum autem et Crispum· Η111.ΙΙΙ.32; Ann. III. 49.

18. ultra: i.e. beyond the Roman army, when once defeated.
formidinis: cause osseam Cp. eg. ch. 36, 12 ; 41, 13; Prop. IIL
(lV.) 13, 38 ; Lucan, VII. 72, modern languages being often more
precise and analytic than the Latin. vacua castella: abandoned
sorte. Probably rhetorical plurale, like coloniae below, the statement
being an intentional exaggeration. ¹

19. inter, eid: What with reluctant obediente ou tlte one barad,
aad unlust authority on thember, tlte 1011111010, etc. Cp. note ch.
31,12. petentes. . . imperantes = obsequium . . . imperium.
On this usage see note ch. 4, 11.

20. aegra: ill at ease. An exceedingly common metaphor, both
in Greek and Latin. In reference to towns, eg. Soph. Ant. 10153
Claud. Bell. Get. 437. —The two adjectives are used predicatively, on
which usage see Introd. p. xxv. municipia: Verulamium, and,
possibly, Londinium, though the plural may be merely rhetorical.
On the position between the two attributes, see Introd. p. xxvi.
Hic dux: viz. Calgacus himself.

21. metalla: this contradicts ch. 31, 18, unless we suppose that
foreign 01 British mines are here meant to be distinguished 110111 Cale-
donian. et ceterae: this phrase, usually alter apolysyndetic enn-
meration, is characteristic 01 Tacitean style.

22. in hoc campo: ie. depende upon the battle to be fought on
this field. The statement is common in speeches 01 this nature. Cp.
Arm. II. 15, aliud sibi reliquum quam tenere libertatem aut mori unte
seruitium.

24. maiores . . . cogitate: more emphatic than the more usual
construction with de. Cp. Plin. Epist. 11. l, 12, Verginium cogito.

dhapter 33. Tne speech of Agricola (33, 10111) a princ,
point 101 point, against that 01 Calgacus. Here, as there, the situ-
ation is represented as critical; there is an appeal tc the valor 01 the

soldiers, the rewards 01 victory and the dire consequences 01 1 defeat
are dwelt upon in both. Finally a supreme confidente in the out-
come, based upon former achievements, and a depreciation 01 the
enemy, are expressed by both speakers. This perient parallelism 01
structure would be alone sufficient to stamp both speeches as works
01 the imagination. The addrees oi Agricola, however, unlike that
01 CeIgacrm, may have had some historical background (see note ·’
