statements which clearly belong together.

22, 21. 61 eret ut] et at erat-Henrichsen. This emendation,
independently suggested also by Purser, l.c. p. 192, is extremely easy
and satisfactory, while at erat 61 the MSS. or et erat at is awkward
and ambiguous, referring equally to what precedes and to what 161-
lows But Tacitus would certainly not affirm the charge involved in
acerbior. With Hearichsen’s reading, he qualifies the statement in
two ways. Agricola was not coerceatur at best only iniucundus,
and even that only adversas malos, ior he was habitually cornia 16611.

23, 25. percucurrerat] percurrerat—Bm), Woelfflin. Tacitus
seems to have avoided the reduplicated forms in compounds.

24, 32. nave prima transgressus: crossing over with aileet 161

exception unwarranted. See 0. 11. 328 and notes ad loc.

interpolation 61 interiora parant, apert irom its holdness, attributes
to Tacitus a most gratuitous statement. Ia melias ie probably the
marginal note or interlinear gloss 61 some patriotie Irish scribe which
subsequently intruded into the text. The MS. tradition oi the Apric-

Irishmen, lends 6616116 the supposition that the archetypon came

their ieelings by marginal remarks oi this nature.

25, 21. timebantrrr] timebat-Ritter, liniebant-MSS. Agricola
is the subject throughout (incohabat, amplexus, exploravit). There
is, therefore, no reason 161 writing timebantur, particularly estimabat
is an equally simple correction. Agricola ieared that the march 61
’ a Roman army might be rendered dangerous by the presence oi the
natives through whose territoryv they had to pass.

26, 11. 61 Romanis: I should prefer to read at with Baehrens.

28, 9. uno renavigante] ano retro remigante. cp. 0. R. 329.
The MSS. read uno remigante, which is admittedly corrupt.

29, 24. Probably Tacitus wrote tulit, aad (set) 161 tulit et, a case
oi haplography, the final ‘t’ (61 tulit) being, as often, mistaken 161
