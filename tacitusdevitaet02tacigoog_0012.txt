LIFE Aah wntrmcs OF TACITUS.

Βία-Ρ. Cornelius Tacitus seems to hare been born of
an equestrian family in northern Italy.l The date of his
birth can be only approximately determined from a refer·
enee in the correspondence oi Pliny the Younger, Tacitus's
intimate and lifelong friend. In a letter addressed to
Tacitus (Epist. VII. 20, 24) we are told that the latter,
though propemodum sequals, had already achieved a great
oratorical reputation, while he himself was still odolescen-
tulus. The allusion is quite vague, but as Pliny was born
in 62 nn, having reached his eighteenth year at the time

, oi the destruction of Pompeji in 7 9 an, Tacitus cannot

well have been horn earlier then 54s55 A.n.‚ a date which
agrees with what little other biographical information we
possess oi him. He seems to have received his education
in Rome, for it is all but certain that he was, like Pliny, a
pupil of Quintilian. At all events, his earliest extant work,
the Dio-lopus de oratoribus, published not later than the
reign of Titus (79—81A.n.)‚exhibits many clear traces of
the influenoe of that great teaoher.² According to his own
statement, he served his forensic apprenticeship under two

11t is a most curicus fact that not a single grem writer ln Latin

literature was a native Roman.
