3. ἐπιτηδεύματα. 4. πράξεις. 5. σύγκρισις. 6. ἐπίλογος. Their
order is definitely fixed only for the first, the second, and
the last; in the arrangement of the others certain preferences
are expressed, but otherwise considerable latitude is allowed.
No rhetorically trained writer seems to have ventured to
emancipata himself from this traditione] norm, except in
minor details; but in the handling of the subject matter,
an author was less hampered, his treatment being natu-
rally conditioned by countless consideratione inherent in
the theme itself, in the circumstances under which he
wrote, and in the purpose he had in view.

Now acomparison between these rhetorical precepts and
illustrations and the Agricola reveals the fact that Tacitae,

’ as far as possible, followed similar models.

1. Prooemium (ch. 1-3). As already remarked, no rigid
or precise rules for the introduction to the βασιλικὸς λόγος
or any other of the many encomia are laid down, but instead
alarge number of suggestions is enumerated from which a
choice might be made. The prooemium of the Agricola is
one oi exquisite art and originality‚ ior not only does it
impart considerable information of a strictly introductory
nature, but, at the same time, it succeeds in giving that
peculiar perspectiva in which Tacitus doubtless desired his
readers to view the story of this herc.

2. Γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή. These subjecte are discussed
in oh. 4 f, the resemblance to Menander's illustratione being
particularly striking,¹ a fact which, of course, does not
invalidate the trustworthiness of the statements themselves.
It is, moreover, nottho identity of arrangement as such

εὐγενείας ἐροῦμεν (= ob. 4, 1 fr. vetere et inlustri . . . colonia. . . eques-
tris nobilitas, etc.); Menander, IX. 219 i. (= III. 371), μετὰ τὴν ’γένε-
σιν &pers τι καὶ περὶ φύσεως (this is given by Tacitus at the close, ch. 44,
eae.) . . . ἑξῆς. . . ἠ ἀνατροφή (=4, Sff.) . . . δεῖ. . . τὴνφύσιν τῆς
