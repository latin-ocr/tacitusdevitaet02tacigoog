The Historical retronea-5. Σύγκρισις. Immediately
upon the account of the ethnology and geography of Britain
there follows in our trectise a fairly detailed' retrospect
concerning the predecessors of Agricola (ch. 1348), and it,
too, has been pronounced out of place in a biography. But
this-objection is also unwarranted, for here again Tacitus
strictly conforms to the rules for the βασιλικὸς λόγος, the
historioal surrey being clearly in the nature of a σύγκρισις
or comparison, which is invariably given as an integral
part of the biographical encomium.l And that Tacitus him·
self regarded these and the preceding chapters as legitimate
and essential is indicated by ch. 18,17, ίιιιιιο Britannice
elotum, bos bellorum uices Agricola . . . incenit, with which
words he introduces the πράξεις ἐν πολέμῳ of his hero.

The σύγκρισις is preferably made to follow the πράξεις and
is placed immediately before the ἐπίλογος,2 but its position
was not definitely fixed³ and Tacitus was therefore perfectly
at liberty to insert it where he chose, without violating
any rhetorical standards. With that keen eye for effec-
tive dramatic grouping which distinguishes him above all

among ancient historiens took the greatest pains in regard to the
topograplry aud strategio movements ol a battle, do not wholly satisfy
modern standards of accuracy and clearness, forthey, too, occasionally
succumbed to the temptation of rhetorical embellishrnent.
