In 77 A.1›., the already renowned orator was betrothed to
the daughter of Agricola, the marriage1 taking place shortly

About the same time began his official career. The pas

of a tribunae militurn, serviug also as one 61 the cipinti
oiri, a lower magistraoy, given to men possessing the cenans
senatoriae, and usually the direct stepping-stone to the
quaestorship. To this office he seems to have been ap
