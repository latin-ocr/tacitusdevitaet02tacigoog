10. rari: on the ellipsis oi scd, see Introd. p. xxxi.

11. linis . . . satietas brit: aiptt aad reptatioa put 011 aad to
tite putauit. -On the singular predicate, cp. note ch. 4, 21. caesa
hostium . . . cecidere: ancient historiens generally shrink from
giving an exact number 01 the fallen in battle, even when such was
ascertainable. They prefer a round number instead, usually more or
less exaggerated, 01 0100 they 10110111 from mentioning any. Cp. Plin.
Epist. IX. 16, 1, cum historicorum 1110νο sumbus auctarum iniri uon
potuisse. That this was the practice 01 Tacitus is expressly attested
by a now lost passage 01 his Historias, cited by Orosius, VII. 10, 4,
uisi G. Tacitus . . . de 1011001110 interfectorum altatare 01 Sallustium
et alios 01010100 . . . sanaim 01 se ipsum idem potissimum elegisse
dixisset. In his extant works there are only saur other exceptions,
viz. 001111. 33,11 (0101 60,000 Germane slain); Hist. 11. 17 (1100
Romans); Anti. IV. 73 (1300 Romans) ; XIV. 37 (80,000 Britons,
400 Romans). -The ad decem milia is, 01 course, a mere guess. Cp.
Herodian. ΙΙΙ. 7, 6, πλῆθος τῶν ,ἑκατέρωθεν ἀνῃρημένων. . . ὡς ἕκαστος
ἠβουλήθη τῶν τότε συγγραψάντων ἱστόρησεν. The Roman loss os 360
isperbaps authentia, the information being probably due to Agricola
himself. - 011 the repetition 01 the verb, see note ch. 32, 16.

13.· inquis: this archaia iorm occurs only here in the minor
works, though very common in the later uniiuga—Tacitus had
spoken (ch. 35, 15) 01 the glory 01 winning a victory without loss 01
Roman blood. The 101001 this prefect is incidentally noted as
the only apparent exception, 10101011 his death wasdue to amere
accident. A modern writer would probably have mentioned this ina
footnote.

Ohapter 38. 15. nox . . . vietofibus: ie. the night was passed
joyfully by the 1101010, owing to the soldiers’ delight in their success
and the resultant booty. et . . . quidem . . . Britanni: the ellip-
sis oi sed, extremely common in Tacitus, is especially so aiter 01 . . .
quidem.

16. palantes, separattay, equivalent to 0011, above, 01 1110100101
(ch. 10, 15), is a 10101110 term in Tacitus, and used 01 soldiers break-
ing their ranke.
