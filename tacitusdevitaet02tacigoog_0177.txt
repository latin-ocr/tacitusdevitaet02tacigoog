neaux’s editi0n‚ Closs. Reoieto, XIII. (1890), p. 213. The item oi the
MSS, changed by Rhenanus into ita, which, ii the original, would
hardly have been thus corrupted, seems to be nothing more than a
dittography oi the final letters· oi frontem. The confusion oi et, at,
ot is notoriously frequent, while the ellipsis oi sed in an adversative
asyndeton Is characteristically Tacitean. cp. Iatrod. p. xxxi.

Closs. Rea. XII. (1898), p. 356, to read eiiam for aciem, though paleo-
graphically very easy, involves a flat contradiction oi the context,
whether we take etiam in the sense oi eaeo or oi also, as is avident
from hi. . . fugacissimi and qnos. . . deprehensi sant.

36,Ιο eantum turmae: the explanation given in the note ad
loc, i ieel oonvInoed, dIsposes oi the many difficulties to which this
passage has given rise, without altering the text, although it is possi-
ble that equitum merely represents afalso solution oi the compendium
intended Ior equoratn. There were no equites among the Caledonians;
on the other hand, the phrase cannot be¹ applied to the Romans without
making the entire paragraph hopelessly uniatelligible3 but inasmuch
as turmae equitum was a well-known technIoal term ior a detachment
of Roman cavalry, nothing was more natural than that the scribe
oi the archetypon understood maltum with torneae. But this word is
frequently used oi a crowd or horde cf animale, and I so interpret it
in this passage, whether we actually read equorum or regard epal-
tam in this sense as one oi Tacitus’s many Vergilian reminiscences.
F. Haverfield (Olcss. Rea. XIII. p, 305) in a very recent redxamIna-
tion oi the fica passages, generally cited ior the use oi eques = equos,
has denied the validity oi this equation. His argumentation does not
appear convincing to me, nor do I seo why eques may not have been
employed in the analogonsly ambiguous sense that horse is in English,
and cccclieric in italien. Op. also Milton, P. L. I. 307, chiceley =
knights. In any case, tho present passage, though hitherto overlooked,
Iumishes a very clear instance of this coniusIon, every other interpre-
tation involving insuperable difficulties.
