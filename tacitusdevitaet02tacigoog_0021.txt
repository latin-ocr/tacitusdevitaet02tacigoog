orate speeches (ch. 30-32, 33-34) are said to be out of
place in a biography.

The Relevency cf ch. ze-As regards the first of these
objections, it may be admitted that a modern writer would
in all probability have relegated the item to a footnote, if
he had thought it worthy of mention at all, but this device
was unknown to the ancients, who were compelled to insert
such passages in the body of the text. The episode is,
however, by no means as irrelevant as it might seem at
first sight, for it admirably shows of what heterogeneous
and unruly elementa the army of Agricola was composed,
thus enhancing the merit of a general capable of fusing
them into an effective instrument of war, a fact subse-
quently emphasized by implication, in that the decisive
battle was won wholly by the Roman auxiliaries, of whom
the Usipi had constituted a part. Again, if the adventure
was thought by Tacitus too noteworthy and interesting to
he omitted, it could have found no other place without
destroying the chronological sequence of events, which
is rigidly adhered to throughout. Finally, the passage
subserves a drommc‘c purpose. The author had been mar-
shaling all his facts to lead up to the deuouement. With
the closing words of ch. 27, 3, etque itu incitetis utrimque
animis discessum, theno less excited reader fcels the op
pressive calm that precedes the storm, feels that the final
crisis is at hand, and just as often in the Greek drama a
soothing choral chant precedes the catastrophe, so Tacitus
has here introduced the maguum oc memorabile fucinus by
way of diversion, before he proceeds in the‘next chapter to
the detailed story oi the final struggle, destined to prove so

alter his retirement, and, therefore, Tacitus passed over the former
briefiy, while the latter are dealt with at some length. The same
method is favored by Menander, lx. 216 (111. 369), τὰ μὴ ἀναγκαῖα

λυσιτελεῖ παρατρέχειν.
