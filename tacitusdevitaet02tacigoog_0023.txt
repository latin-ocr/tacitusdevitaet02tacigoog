duced by some stereotyped phrase which precludes an exact
and genuine reproduction.¹

The ancients rosor-ted to this rhetorical expedient in the
conviction that by so doing they could more vividly and
objectiwely portray the feelings aud the motives by which -
the principa] characters were actuated, and thus at the
same time define the issues and reflect the spirit of the
contending parties.²

Now, inasmuch as Tacitus was writing the life, not of a
poet or scientist or philosopher, but oi a general who was
himself helping to make history, it was inevitable that he
should deal with πράξεις, which were the special province of
the historiari, and thus the rhetorical exigencies of historical
prose of which speeohes constituted an integral part, would
be sufficient to justiiy their insertion in this strictly histori-
cal portion of his biography. If the speeohes of Calgacus
and Agricola are to be condemned as irrelevant in a genuine
biography, the description of the battle, constituting as it
did an equally integral feature of historioal narrative,8
should have met with the same condemnation‚ and yet no
one has ever made the least objection to it in spite of its
rhetorical and all but imaginative character.⁴

2The stereotyped rhetorical character ol these military harangues is
perhaps best shown by the numerous parallelisms in sentiment, often
expressed in similar phraseology, found in the speeohes of Thucydides,
Livy, Curtius, and Sallust, although in the case of the last mentioned
direct indebtedness oi Tacitus is reasonably certain. See below.
