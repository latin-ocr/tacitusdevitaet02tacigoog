PURPOSE OF THE AGRICOLA. xix

writer, however fresh his sorrow or pungent his grief, never
forgot that he was primarily an artist and hence, while col·
lecting such consolatory commonplaces as seemed called
for, he, at tho same time, spared no effort in presenting
them in stylistically elaborated form. Now the marvelous
achievcment of Tacitus consiste in this. Although many of
the pathetic sentimenta in the closing paragraph are mere
rhetorical τόποι,1 he has, nevertheless, succeeded in creating
an indelible impression of genuine sorrow, affection, and
deep sincerity. .

We, therefore, conclude that the Agricola of Tacitus is
exactly what its author says it was —a eulopistic biography,
constructed, as we have seen, on fairly orthodox rhetorical
lines, more particularly in accord with the detailed rules
governing the βασιλικὸς λόγος, preserved in Menandcr’s περὶ
ἐπιδεικτικῶν, which, though of a late date, merely reflecte
orthodox, scholastic traditions. But these, in their sub-
stance, far autedate the time of Tacitus himself.

Wholly distinct from the discussion of the structural
character¹ of the Agricola, though habitually confounded

its real purpose. Tacitus, it is true,·has here also expressly
