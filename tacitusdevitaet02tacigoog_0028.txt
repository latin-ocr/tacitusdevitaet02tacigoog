inferences have long since been recognized as unwarranted,
but it is only recently that Tacitus has been fully vindi-

very preface vibrates with indignation at the memory of
the reign of terror. No doubt an nnmeasured denunciation
of Domitian’s rule would have been received with favor.
Instead, Tacitus determined to write the life of a man who¹
