ΙΙ.
THE LITERARY omnesne OF m AGRICOLA.⁸

The opening chapter oi the introduction deals exclusively
with the biographical and autobiographioal treatises of
former times, the Agricola being expressly designated asa
citu defuncti hominis at its close. Two other instantes of
biography are added at the beginning of the second chapter,
and in the epilogue the biographical characteres his work
is again emphasized hythe author.4 But in spite of these
explicit statements, modern scholare have persistently re-
fused to accept Tacitus’s own classification of this work,
on the ground that the treatise flagrantly violates certain
alleged canons of biographioal composition, which must, of
course, elther have been unknown to Tacitus or deliberately
ignored by him. But when the problem arose of assigning
to it a more suitable designation, a great diversity of opinion
was revealed‚ partly due to an habitual confusion with the
question as to the purpose of the treatise. Eliminating
this for the present from the discussion as irrelevant, we
find that the principal objections against the assumption
that the Agricola is a biopruphp resolve themselves into two.
