(ionicae. He is mentioned as the youngest err-consul to give his opin-
ion in regard to the punishment oi Marius Prncus, the proconsul oi
Africa, who was convicted oi extortion in 100 nn, Pliny and Tacitus
appearing ior the plaintifi. Prisco: the praenomen and nornen
pentile are alike unknown, and even the cognomen is doubtful, being
also given as Pristinus.

23. habitum: externat appearance.

24. decentior quam sublimior: attractiva rather then impoainp.
-decentior serves as a comparative for decorae, the Latin avoiding‚
ii possible, the collocationofr's, soeg. ferne, ferocior ,· aeirus, mira-
bilior. The present iorm is, however, rare, except in Quintilian.
nihil metus ln widin: ie. there was nothing in his countenance‚ as
in the case oi Domitian (ch. 45, 22; Plin. Pon. 48), to inspire iear.
-raetns, in an active sense, is common in Tacitus and post-Augustan
writers.

25. gretia oris: ueniet, street expression. In this obiective sense,
the word is found only in poetry and post-Augustan prose, and is
especially frequent in Quintilian, eg. VI. prooem. 7, qnid ille proiice
in nnita. supererat: predome'nated. For other meanings ol this
word, cp. ch. 22, 22, 34, 29, 44, 2, 45, 7, and the discussion in Geli.

early as Plautus, eg. Stich. I. 2, 23 (vs. 84), decurso aetatis spatio,-
but the phrase medio in spatio, with the unusual position oi the adiec-
tive as here, seems to have been taken from Cic. de oret. III. 2, 7, a
passage which bears other points oi resemblance to these closing
chapters. See below. — interrae is virtually equivalent to an apposi-
tional clause, defining spatio aetatis· We may, therefore, translate: Gnt
off in the very prime os life, while hia scontties erere still uninrpaired.

27. quantum ad: the usual iorm in Tacitus ior the more common
quod attinet ad, on which see note ch. 33, 19.

28. Opibus nimiis, etc. : be toole no delient in arcessire rietes,
and, ar a matter· os sect, resplendent rocetta bod net fallen to liis tot.
macionus is avery strong expression. ‚cp Ann. Ill. 55, opibus . . .
speciosas. -The statement itscli is amply confirmed by other passages
in this treatise, for the loss oi Agricola's patrimony (ch. 4, 7; 7, 8),
his conduct as praetor (ch. 6, 29), his scrupulous honesty (ch. 6, 20;
