19. laureatis ε sc. 11111111. The laurel,be1ng the symbol of martial
victorias, was sent with the official reports which commandere for·
warded to the emperor. -The elliptical phrase seems to occur only
here and Hist. III. 17.

20. ismae lamam: ior a similar chiasmus, cp. Ama I. 39, lepe-
1111 populi Romani Romanis in 1011111. aestimantibus, etc. : ie.

, people reasoned that a still greater future was in store 101 a man who

could be reticent about achievements so noteworthy.=-The construc-¹
tion is probably an elliptical dative rather than an ablat. abs.; see note
ch. 34, 30.

21. tam magna: more emphatic than tenta and comparatively
rare. -With the thought, cp. lustin. XI. 1, ita moderate de sc multe
pollicitus 111, ut adpareret pluro 111111 experimentis reservare, and
Ana. ΙΙ. 22, dc 11 nihil addit, 1111111 1111111111 cn retes conscientiam
sacto 11111 1111.

Ohapter 19. 22. animorum .. prudens: well aepactmce 111111
1111 temper.

2³. doctus per eliens experimenta: tcepht ep 1111 experiente
os 0111111. So 1110134, idenditas . . . 01111111 experimentis. For
the meaning of experimentum, see note ch. 16, 24.

24. excidere: 11111011, eradicate. Cp. Cic. 11111101.00111111.18,
43, tristissimum tempos . . . 11 calmo . . . 1110111111. Surgical
or medical metaphors are comparatively rare in Tacitus and else-
where in Latin, except in Cicero, who had a peculiar fondness for
them.

27. nihil, cte: sc. apere. Such ellipses of a verb oi doing 01
acting, though not unusual, are particularly frequent in Tacitus. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxi. publicas rei: public business. So again Germ.
13, 30. In this sense, the adjective must precede, because 111 pul)-
le'cc always has its restricted political meaning, but in other combina-
tions with ree in Tacitus, the attribute as a rule follows the noun¹
See Introd. p: xxvi.

29. ascire sed optimum. . . putere = ascire scd optimam . . .
010111 quie 111111 . . . putabet. On the prolepsis, see 11111011. p. xxx,

. 30. exsequi: ie. while he kept himself informed 01 everything,
he did not always act upon this knowledge. The word, as shown
by poena below, cannot here signify 10 pectet, a meaning, moreover‚
not found elsewhere in Tacitus, though common in Livy. With the
statement itseli, cp. Irrtrod. p. xii. 2.
