Pliny and Senecio for malfeasance in the government of Hispania.
The trial resulted in his conviction, but the sentence was not carried
out.

17. nostrae . . . manus: ie. of senators, including Tacitus.
Cp. Plin. IX. 13, 2, ia senato senator senatori . . . manos intulisset,
where the trial of Helvidius is narrated at length. Helvidium:
son of Helvidius Priscus (on whom cp. note ch. 2, 18), consul 87 un.
He was accused of lese maiestd and executed. The date oi his death
isfixed by this passage, ie. shortly after August 23, 93 Λα).

18. Maurici: Iunios Mauricos, brother of Rusticus, whose exe·

cuticn is referred to in ch. 2, 17, an intimate friend and correspondent ’

cf Pliny the Younger, and highly esteemed hy Nerva and Trajan. In
tc an. he requested Vespasian to submit to the senate the names of
all informers found in the imperial records. Cp. Tac. Hist. IV. 40.
He was hanished by Domitian, but recalled hy Nerva. maus: sc.
foedavit, to be supplied hy zeugma out of perfodit, and this the more
easily, because conpote is often joined with both these verbs. Le. us ,
the sight cf Mauricus, sent into exile, and of Rusticus, led to execu-
tion, has polluted; us Senecio besprinkled with his innocent blood.

19. Senecio: sec note ch. 2, 18. tamen: i.e. despite his cruel
disposition. subtraxit oculos: the phrase, found also Arta. 111. 533
XVI. 26, and its analogue, subtrahere coros, seems to be Tacitean.

21. videre: sc. eam. adspicl: sc. ab eo.

22. 'subscriberenturz ie. the ever-present informers would
record ¹our very sighs to he made to iestify against us on some
future occasion. denotandis: to moloc ntentol note os. On the
final gerundive, see note ch. 23, 23; with sufficere, as here, eg. Ana.
III. 72, and Quint. Ι. 9, 3.

23. palloribus: abstract for concrete, cp. note cb. 16, 21. Here
perhaps influenced hy robor, with which it seems intentionally con·
trusted. —Domitian's very look sufficed to drive the blood from many
aiace, which would not escape the delatores. vultus et rubor:
with its ruddy ploro. This is attested by Tac. Hist. IV. 40 ; Plin.
Poncp. 483 Suet. Dona. 18, though different and less disparaging
reasons for it were occasionally given.

24. contra pudorem muniebat: his ruddy complexion did not
. allow a blush of shame, which his atrocities should have called forth,
to be seen or recognized as such. The passage seems slightly incon-
sistent with oh. 42, 14, nec eruhuit. With the statement itself, cp.
Seu. Epist. 11, 3. ’
