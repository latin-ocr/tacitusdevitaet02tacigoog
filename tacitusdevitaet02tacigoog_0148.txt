nos aa] noras. calerna u. 129

aliquando . . . virtusque: sc. redit, as shown by Tacitus’s model,
Verg. Aen. 11. 367, quondam etiem ciclis redit io praecordia civius.
cp. also San. Trood. 6711, inermes offeram manus Dabit irc uires,
with the same antithesis as in ll. 29 f.

Pago 25. 1. adpropinquaverunt: so. Britanni, easily supplied
from the preceding victis, and made necessary by the context. iden-
tidem: to be taken with conlecti, ie. on approaohing the foreste, the
·Britons repeatedly rallied.

2. primos sequentium incautos: ie. those Roman soldiers who
festinatione uictoriae incautiously followed the fieeing enemy in ad-
vance oi the pursuing cohorte, the Britons, etc. -The irregular word-
order vves caused bya desire for succinet and rliythmical expression.
-On the use oi the adjective (incautos) ior the adverb, sea note ch.
5, 2. The entire passage closely resembles Liv. XXII. 31, 4.

3. frequens ubique: who loos everywhere conspicooosly colice— .

The phrase is pleonastio, ior the sake oi emphasis. Cp. note ch.
22, 16.

4. indaginis modo: oster ilic ovoszner o! c cordon. The figure is
taken from hunting, the wild beasts being driven into one spot and
surrounded by nete, Cp, Verg. Aen. 111. 121. The simile is very ire-
quently applied to the enclosing oi enemies, eg. Liv. VII. 37, 14.

6. persultare: to sooor, roone over. Here, as also elsewhere in·
Tacitus, the verb is used in a more general sense, and therefore appli-
cable to infantry as well. acceptum aliquod. . . fiduciam ieret:
the participle is unusually iar removed irom its auxiliary, probably
here ior the purpose of securing alliceretive groups. Cp. also Lucret.
1.76; Tac. Aoo. XII. 16, coepto . . . soret.

’1. vulnus: damase. This figurative sense oi caloes, especially
frequent with occipere, is a euphemiam for clades. In Tac. again,

⁶ Ano. IL 21.

8. compositos . . . ordinibus: ie. when it was seen that the
Romans had recovered irom the confusion into vvhich they had been
thrown, and were again pursuing in battle array, etc.

9. versi=sc uenerunt. See note ch. 18, 20. alius alium
respectantes = in vicem r. The phrase, also with the plural verb,
is found in Sall. Hist. froom. (Speech oi Lepidus) Ι. 41, 20 D, clius
alium principem expectantes and the construction is quite common in
Livy. In Tacitus only here, and used to avoid the repetition oi
iaoioem or iuter se.
